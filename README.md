## About This Repo

This project automatically generates a professionally formatted PDF resume from markdown content using GitHub Actions. The workflow triggers on updates to the resume markdown file and applies custom CSS styling.

## How it Works

1. Write/update resume content in markdown format
2. Push changes to trigger the GitHub Action
3. Action converts markdown to PDF using Puppeteer
4. Styled PDF is automatically committed back to the repo
